# Box Shooter!

## About

This is one of my first attempts at building a game using **Unity3D** and **C#**, built during the course of the online program **"Introduction to Game Development"** by the **Michigan State University** and taught by **Brian Winn**.

This game constantly under development and is yet very far from perfect, but still pretty playable. Any and all suggestions are welcome.

## Game Description
This a first-person shooter simulation where a player needs to shoot down floating boxes all around him in a three dimensional space, within the time limit.
Their are special boxes too. Some extra time, while some deduct time, so be careful where you direct your pew-pew gun!
Game ends when the time limit ends.

## How to play
I have included a **WebGL** build for people to run on their browsers.
It works on **Firefox**, but be warned though, that WebGL might not work on Chrome.

## Technologies employed
* Unity3D 5.4
* C#

## Credits
The sound effects of the game were provided by Brian Winn.
